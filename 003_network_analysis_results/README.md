# Results of Network Analysis

## Description of Scripts
* **network_analysis.R:** Network analysis as described in the manuscript either using STRING or HumanNet. Checking whether effects are significant via randomization.
* **network_analysis_exclude_knowngenes.R:** Same script as in network_analysis.R. Exclusion of known genes (*BRCA1*, *BRCA2*, *PALB2*, *MSH2*, *MLH1*) from the analysis.
* **cytoscape_input.R:** Making input files, which can be directly used in Cytoscape to create network visualizations. Either using STRING or HumanNet.
